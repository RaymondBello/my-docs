#  Project Documentation

This page is a great place to explore some my hardware prototypes, software, and other tools. 
As well as find all the information you need to build your own.

## Hardware Prototypes

## Software & Tools

Various software related projects and tools.

```python title="flash.py"
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime

keyboard = Controller() 

def press_keys_every(hold =3 , sleep_val = 60 , repeat = 3):
    '''
    Executes the defined key press sequence every `sleep_val` seconds
        Paramaters: 
            float: hold - number of seconds to hold down key
            float: sleep_val - number of seconds to sleep after executing key press sequence
            int: repeat - number of times to repeat loop
    '''
    
    repeat = 60 * repeat
    t_delta = 0

    for num in range(repeat):
        t_now = datetime.now()
        keyboard.press(Key.up)
        sleep(hold)
        keyboard.release(Key.up)
        print(f"Time Delta (H:M:S.uS): {t_delta} | {t_now}\n#{num+1}/{repeat} Finished key sequence, now sleeping for {sleep_val - hold} seconds.\n")
        sleep(sleep_val - hold)
        t_delta = datetime.now() - t_now

    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\n*** Starting Awaken ***\n")

        else:
            # Edit this for modification

        if res == 0:
            print("*** Awaken has finished running ***")
            
    except:
        print("[ERROR] Awaken was interupted...\n")
