# Technical Documentation
This MCU is responsible for polling IMU sensors at a high-rate, listening for incoming radio commands and actively stabilizing the aircraft about a desired setpoint.<br/>
The <i>Flight Control Computer</i> (<b>FCC</b>) is based on the RP2040 microcontroller clocked @ 133MHz this is fast enough to run the external PID control loop as well handle all the calculations needed for reliable attitude estimation.<br/>

### Power
The RP2040 chip requires two different voltage supplies 3.3V (for I/O's) and 1.1V (for the chips digital core).
The main power source for this embedded system is a 3-6S LiPo Battery. Both MCU's are powered via a single 5V USB connection despite needing seperate USB connectors to program, this done to aid debugging. 

## Power Requirements
- Step-down LiPo 11.2-26V DC Input to 5V for actuators 
- Supply both MCU's with 3.3V from either USB_VBUS or VCC.

## Battery & 5V Power Supply
To step down 11.2V from the LiPo Battery to 5V a DC/DC Buck Regulator rated to a max. of 28V is needed.<br/>The <b>Micrel MIC26903</b> is used to supply 5V @ 8A to all the actuators and 3.3V regulators.

## 3.3V Power 
Both USB ports are connected to a LDO providing 3.3V @2A to both MCU's and their peripherals.
