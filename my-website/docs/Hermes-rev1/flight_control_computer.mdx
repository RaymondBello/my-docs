# Flight Control Computer
This MCU is responsible for polling IMU sensors at a high-rate, listening for incoming radio commands and actively stabilizing the aircraft about a desired setpoint.<br/>
The <i>Flight Control Computer</i> (<b>FCC</b>) is based on the RP2040 microcontroller clocked @ 133MHz this is fast enough to run the external PID control loop as well handle all the calculations needed for reliable attitude estimation.<br/>

## Hardware Design
The <b>Flight Control Computer</b> consists of 7 main elements:
- [Power](flight_control_computer#power)
- [Flash Storage](flight_control_computer#flash-storage)
- [Crystal Oscillator](flight_control_computer#crystal-oscillator)
- [Sensors](flight_control_computer#sensors)
- [Radio](flight_control_computer#radio)
- [Actuators](flight_control_computer#actuators)
- [IOs](flight_control_computer#ios-external-interfaces)
