# Overview
Hermes is designed to function as the base flight control system responsible for guidance, navigation and control of a fixed-wing UAV - but general enough for most other vehicles.

## Aims
- Design a complete flight control system from scratch (hardware, software, control systems, navigation algorithms, ground control station, etc..)
- <b>Goal</b>: Complete system consisting of standardised hardware and basic but robust software framework.
- <b>Focus on developing and testing novel algorithms - not writing low-level code!</b>

## Hardware Requirements
- Standard set of sensors (e.g. IMU, barometer, ..)
- Expansion and interface capabilities via various IOs.
- Power distribution for servos.
- Processing power.
- <b>Affordability!</b>

## Next Steps
A list of a few things to complete:
- [ ] [ 0%] Telemetry and messaging protocol.
- [ ] [ 0%] Aircraft modelling, control system design and implementation.
- [ ] [ 0%] Higher-level firmware (state machine, guidance algorithms, etc.)
- [ ] [50%] Low-level firmware (e.g. device drivers and interfaces).
- [ ] [90%] State Estimation (Madgwick & Kalman filters).
- [X] [100%] Ground control station.
