# Bits&Bytes:*0x02*

I think I'm currently at a mini-crossroad. 
On one hand, I could rewrite the entire portion of code responsible for attitude estimation in order to make the estimation algorithm more robust and easier to work with. 
Or, I could continue trying to tweak the current estimation filter gains in order to get a more reliable attitude estimation. 

One path requires substantially more work, the other not as much. 
The goal of the project as a whole is to make a flight control system that is both robust and easy to work with, and there's only one path that aligns with this original goal, hence a complete redesign of my attitude estimation algorithm is not only recommended but **required**. 

So I'll be using the next couple of posts to outline the new estimation algorithm I will be designing/testing. 
Wish me luck.

## Tasks contd.

### MPU9250 IMU Driver

- [ ] **In-Progress**: Implement full scale range and gyro sensitivity selection, currently using default settings.
- [ ] **Outstanding**: Add hardware reset & calibration sequence

### Attitude Estimation

- [ ] **In-Progress**: Refactor the existing attitude estimation algorithm with modularity/flexibility in mind.
