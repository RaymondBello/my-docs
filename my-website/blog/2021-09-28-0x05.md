# Bits&Bytes:*0x05*

## It's all about timing

After a couple of days of refactoring parts of my flight control codebase to support a more modular design. I decided to additionally transition to using a RTOS as the base OS for my flight controller.
I have some experience working with ChibiOS and as well as FreeRTOS.
But for this application/hardware, FreeRTOS has better platform support.
