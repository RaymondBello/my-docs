# Bits&Bytes:*0x04*

## Attitude Control System PCB Design

After generously receiving a prerelease alpha RP2040 stamp from @arturo182, I decided to use his chip as the main MCU for my control system. 
This 40-pin form-factor is perfectly suited for my application, since it allows me to seperate the MCU and peripharals so they can both be validated independently.

## Hardware components

- [RP2040 Stamp][RP2040 Arturo182] - Flight Computer
- MPU6050 - 3-Axis Accelerometer & 3-Axis Gyroscope
