# Bits&Bytes:*0x04*

## Matek inspired this...

I've spent alot of time thinking about an ideal size for my final PCB.
There are currently some contraints that should be taken into account when planning on minimizing cost, maximazing flexibility and adhereing to airframe dimensions.

I have been doing some research on this topic and I've found that there seems to be a widespread agreement on what an ideal size should be for an onboard flight control system (amongst hobbyists and commercially).

MatekSys have made numerous flight control boards over the years so its safe to say their designs have been tried and true especially in the hobbyist community. The F405 Wing is probably one of their most popular boards. And I happen to own a couple F405's myself.

## Small Big Brother

The F411 Wing is the smaller updated version of the F405 board with all the essentials included. I don't own one but I plan on using a layout very similar to the F411 in my own design. The peripherals, connector and solder pad placement are some of the main traits that I plan on trying to carry over into my own design.

Updates to follow...
