# Bits&Bytes:*0x04*

## Attitude Control System PCB 

After generously receiving a pre-release alpha RP2040 stamp from @arturo182, I decided to use his chip as the main MCU for my control system. 
The 40-pin SOC form-factor is perfectly suited for my application, since it allows me to separate the MCU and peripherals so they can both be validated independently.

## Hardware components

- [RP2040 Stamp][RP2040 Arturo182] - Flight Computer
- MPU6050 - 3-Axis Accelerometer & 3-Axis Gyroscope
- MPL3115A2 - Barometric Pressure Sensor

I also added a 40-pin 2.54mm header to connect a raspberry pi zero w. 
The Pi Zero W will be used as the main flight computer responsible for guidance and navigation. The RP2040 will handle all control aspects of the UAV.
